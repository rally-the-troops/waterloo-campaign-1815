<h1>
RULEBOOK
</h1>

<p>
Waterloo Campaign 1815

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
Waterloo Campaign, 1815 is a low complexity wargame focused on French
Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's 1815 Belgian campaign that resulted in his
final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18th. He was opposed by a Coalition
of Anglo-Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces under
Generalfeldmarschall von Blücher.

<h2>
Set Up
</h2>

<p>
After deciding which scenario to play and who will play each side,
the players refer to the historical setup found at the end of these rules,
marking which hex units begin the scenario, or on which turn and at
which map entry hex they arrive as a reinforcement.

<h2>
Key Concepts and Definitions
</h2>

<p class="figure">
<img src="sample_game_counters_and_markers.png">

<p>
The players should refer to this list as a guide to understanding the
terms and key concepts of Waterloo Campaign, 1815.

<dl>

<dt>
Anglo-Allied:
<dd>
Coalition forces in white, commanded by the
Wellington HQ. When the rules specify Anglo-Allied, Prussian forces
are excluded.

<dt>
Advance Formation:
<dd>
Most units move around the map in Advance
formation until they enter an enemy Zone of Control, when Infantry
units must flip to Battle formation.

<dt>
Artillery:
<dd>
All Corps have artillery factored into their capabilities
during combat. The French have a Grand Battery Artillery Detachment
that has special capabilities when participating in an attack (see Grand
Battery below).

<dt>
Attack:
<dd>
The acting player designates one unit to attack an adjacent
enemy unit. Dice are rolled and modified, with the lower total losing the
engagement. Attacking is voluntary, not mandatory.

<dt>
Battle Formation:
<dd>
When an Infantry unit enters an enemy Zone of
Control it must flip to Battle formation. Battle formation represents the
unit formed for attack or defense depending on the situation.

<dt>
Cavalry:
<dd>
Both sides field Cavalry units that are distinct from Infantry units. Cavalry units have two sides to their counter, Fresh and Exhausted. An exhausted cavalry unit can move and participate in attacks
normally, just slower and less effectively. Cavalry has special capabilities
in combat.

<dt>
Coalition:
<dd>
Refers to the Anglo-Allied and Prussian side together.

<dt>
Corps:
<dd>
Infantry and Cavalry units of roughly corps size, even if not
historically designated as such. For ease of identification, Corps use
large counters, as distinct from Detachments that are smaller in size.

<dt>
Detachments:
<dd>
Most Corps in Waterloo Campaign have one or more
associated Detachment units that can be placed during Step D of the
Command Phase (Detachment Placement). Regardless of whether a
Detachment shows an infantry or a cavalry symbol, they behave identically in play. Detachments have a ZoC, and are useful for screening,
holding flanks, or as the rearguard when on the strategic retreat. The
Grand Battery and Old Guard Detachments have special rules.

<dt>
Die:
<dd>
Waterloo Campaign uses a six-sided die. It is optimal to have
two different color dice, one for each side. (Not included.)

<dt>
Empty Hex:
<dd>
Take this literally—an empty hex has no units or markers in it. No exceptions!

<dt>
Headquarters (HQs):
<dd>
The French have three and the Coalition have
two HQ markers. These do not represent the location of the named
general and his command staff, but are an abstract representation of the
armies' center of operations for the game turn. You cannot interfere with
an HQ marker or displace it during play. On the Coalition side, the
Anglo-Allied and Prussian HQs each cannot influence or affect forces
of the other. HQs can be in Normal or Battle mode - Normal mode has
greater Command Range, but Battle mode allows the HQ to influence
attacks with their Battle Stars. An HQ's Command Range can be traced
into and through hexes occupied by enemy or friendly units. ZoCs
and ZoIs do not affect Command Range except for the placement of
Detachments.

<dt>
Formation:
<dd>
Infantry units are either on their Advance Formation
side (movement of 4) or on their Battle Formation side (movement
of 1). Cavalry units are either on their Fresh side (movement of 6) or
Exhausted side (movement of 4). During each Organization Phase,
units determine their starting formation for the turn depending on their
proximity to enemy units.

<dt>
French:
<dd>
All units in blue, commanded by the Napoleon, Ney, and
Grouchy HQs.

<dt>
French Grand Battery:
<dd>
This special Detachment can be deployed by
the Napoleon HQ when on its Battle side. The Grand Battery provides
a bonus when attacking.

<dt>
Map Entry Locations:
<dd>
There are five map entry locations, designated with a “B.” Entry locations on the north map edge are 4006 (Halle),
4015 (north of Waterloo), Hex 4025 (north of Wavre). Entry locations
on the south map edge are 1017 and 1018 (Coullet).

<dt>
Markers:
<dd>
Waterloo Campaign includes several markers that are
placed on the map. The Game Turn marker is placed on the game turn
track. HQ markers are used on the map, but take note these are markers
NOT units, and rules that refer to units do not refer to these markers.

<dt>
Movement:
<dd>
During the Movement Phase, players alternate choosing
a Corps to move. The chosen Corps moves a number of hexes up to
the movement allowance of its current Formation. If the Corps moves
exclusively along a road, it may use Road Movement to double its movement allowance (Infantry Corps in Battle formation cannot use Road
Movement).

<dt>
Pass:
<dd>
During the Movement and Attack Phases, the players alternate
choosing a Corps to move or attack respectively. When a player cannot
or chooses not to designate a unit, they must Pass. After a side Passes,
they no longer designate units for the remainder of that phase (movement or attack). The side that did not Pass will receive a number of
moves or attacks based on a die roll.

<dt>
Prussian:
<dd>
Coalition forces in gray, commanded by the Blücher HQ.
When the rules specify Prussian, Anglo-Allied forces are excluded.

<dt>
Road Movement:
<dd>
An Infantry Corps in Advance formation or any
Cavalry Corps (Fresh or Exhausted) whose entire move is on connected
roads may double its movement allowance. Similarly, an HQ in Normal
mode that traces its Command Range entirely along roads may double
its range. Road movement must remain entirely on connected roads, you
cannot mix road and off-road rates.

<dt>
Stacking:
<dd>
Corps cannot stack or move through each other during
movement. No more than one HQ marker or Detachment unit can be
placed in a given hex, regardless of whether the hex contains a Corps.
Friendly Corps can enter, move through, and/or remain in the same hex
as a Detachment.

<dt>
Terrain:
<dd>
See the Terrain Effects Chart for the effects of terrain on
movement and combat.  TEC is on separate Player Aid.

<dt>
Units:
<dd>
Units are combat formations, divided into Corps (Infantry
and Cavalry) using larger counters, and smaller Detachments (whatever
type). HQ markers are not units.

<dt>
Zone of Control (ZoC):
<dd>
The six hexes adjacent to a unit are its Zone
of Control. Corps units and Detachments have a ZoC. ZoCs can halt
or limit enemy movement. There is no additional effect for a hex having
more than one ZoC projected into it.

<dt>
Zone of Influence (ZoI):
<dd>
All hexes within two hexes of a Corps
constitute the unit's Zone of Influence. ZoIs restrict enemy movement and both friendly and enemy Detachment placement. A Zone
of Influence cannot be blocked, it extends through and beyond enemy
units. There is no additional effect for a hex having more than one ZoI
projected into it.

<h2>
Sequence of Play
</h2>

<h2>
Command Phase
</h2>

<p>
For each step below, both sides complete the step fully before moving on
to the next.

<h4>
A. HQ Placement Step
</h4>

<p>
Starting with the French, each player first removes their HQs and
then replaces them on the map. Each HQ must be placed, on either its
Normal or Battle side, in a hex within 3 hexes of an associated unit, even
directly on such a unit. The placement hex cannot be in an enemy ZoC
or ZoI. In the unlikely event that an HQ has no associated units on the
map, place it in any empty hex on the map within 3 hexes of a Brussels
to Couillet road hex, even in an enemy ZOC or ZOI.

<p>
HQs are markers, not units, and do not move; once placed, an HQ does
not change position for the remainder of the turn. An HQ cannot be
eliminated and can coexist with an enemy unit in the same hex.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: This marker represents your command intent. It is not meant
to represent a physical presence. Once placed, you cannot interfere with your
enemy's HQ in any tangible manner.

<h4>
B. Blown Unit Return Step
</h4>

<p>
Starting with the French, each player can return to the map up to two
blown Corps (removed from the map by a blown result two turns prior).
Place these Corps in any empty hex adjacent to an associated HQ, but
not in an enemy ZoC or ZoI. If more than two blown Corps are available to return, the player's opponent chooses which two units return, and
the remainder are eliminated from play.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: It is assumed that the enemy player will pick inferior units to
return to play, but it's their choice.

<h4>
C. Cavalry Corps Recovery Step
</h4>

<p>
Exhausted Cavalry Corps not in an enemy ZoC or ZoI are flipped to
their Fresh side.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Denotes the horses recovering from charging. Don't forget that
enemy Detachments have ZoCs.

<h4>
D. Detachment Placement Step
</h4>

<p>
Starting with the French player, each HQ may place one associated
Detachment on the map.
The HQ must trace a path to the placement hex either:

<p>
&bull; from itself, with a length in hexes up to its own Command Range
(if the HQ is Normal mode, not Battle mode, and the path is traced
entirely by road, double the Command Range)

<p>
OR

<p>
&bull; from the Detachment's parent unit, with a length of up to 4 hexes.

<p>
The path must be free of enemy ZoC or ZoI for its entire length. The
placement hex itself cannot be in any ZoC and ZoI, whether enemy or
friendly.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: This is not a mistake; you cannot place a Detachment in a
friendly Zone of Control or Influence. The intent is a Detachment is there to
protect a flank, bridge, town, or key road junction that is some distance from
your main forces. They are not intended as skirmishers in front of your formation.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: While each HQ can deploy any associated Detachment, a Corps
can only deploy Detachments with their designation. Even if the parent
Corps is eliminated, the HQ can still deploy its Detachments.

<p>
<b>French Grand Battery</b> (Special Detachment): When the Napoleon
HQ is on its Battle side, it can deploy the Grand Battery Detachment to the same hex as any friendly unit within his Command Range,
regardless of enemy ZOCs or ZOIs. This path is not traced, it just needs
to be within 3 hexes of Napoleon. This counts as the Napoleon HQ's
Detachment placement for the turn. Once placed, the Grand Battery
cannot move, but can be Recalled.

<p>
The Grand Battery adds +1 to the combat roll of its attached Corps
when the Corps itself attacks or supports an attack. The Grand Battery
only modifies attacks, not defense. If the Grand Battery is left alone in
a hex due to an advance of the Corps it is stacked with, it is immediately and automatically Recalled, and can be redeployed on a later game
turn. If the Grand Battery is left alone when its stacked unit receives
a retreat or any other combat result, the Grand Battery is eliminated
and removed from play. Otherwise, the Grand Battery is automatically
Recalled at the end of each game turn.

<p>
<b>French Old Guard</b> (Special Detachment): When the Napoleon HQ
is on its Battle side, it can deploy the Old Guard Detachment to any
empty hex within its Command Range, not in an enemy ZOC, but it
can be within an enemy ZOI. This counts as the Napoleon HQ's Detachment placement for the turn. Once placed, the Old Guard cannot
move, but can be Recalled.

<p>
The Old Guard has two Battle Stars, so even when it is attacked while
alone in its hex, it gains this die roll modifier. Like all detachments if it
is stacked with another friendly Corps during combat, the Old Guard
does not add its Battle Stars to the defense or attack.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Due to the 1-per-HQ limit, Napoleon can deploy either the
Grand Battery or the Old Guard on the same turn, not both.

<p class="design note">
Design Note: The first miniature I ever painted was a Grenadier from
the Old Guard. Therefore, it was impossible for me to design a Waterloo game
without an Old Guard unit. I apologize for the extra rule overhead.

<h4>
E. Detachment Recall Step
</h4>

<p>
Starting with the French, each player may Recall all, some, or none of
their Detachments from the map (even one just placed). Detachments
can be Recalled from any location, including in enemy ZoC, while surrounded, etc.; no path need be traced. Recalled Detachments become
available for placement again the following turn.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Essentially, Recalled Detachments must sit out one turn to
become available again for placement.

<p>
<b>British Line of Communication Angst</b>

<p>
If the Anglo-Allied army at the conclusion of Detachment Recall has
three or more Anglo-Allied detachments on the map, eliminated, or any
combination thereof, substitute the Anglo-Allied Hill Corps with two
stars <s>for</s><mark>with</mark> the Hill Corps with one star. At the conclusion of any future
Detachment Recall that there are fewer than 3 Anglo-Allied detachments on the map, substitute the Anglo-Allied Hill Corps with one star
<s>for</s><mark>with</mark> the Hill Corps with two stars.

<p class="historical note">
Historical Note: During the Battle of Waterloo a large portion of Hill's
II Corps was deployed at Hal to protect British communications. These forces
did not participate in the Battle. This rule captures the impact of Wellington's
deployment decision and angst about having his flank turned.

<h2>
Organization Phase
</h2>

<p>
For each step below, both sides complete the step fully before moving
on to the next.

<h4>
F. Advance Formation
</h4>

<p>
Starting with the French, each Infantry Corps that is not in an enemy
ZoC (not ZoI) is set to Advance Formation (flipping from Battle Formation if necessary). This is the only time during a turn that a unit can
flip from Battle Formation to Advance Formation.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Enemy ZoIs do not affect flipping from Battle to Advance
formation.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Cavalry recovers from Exhausted to Fresh in Step C, not this
step.

<h4>
G. Battle Formation
</h4>

<p>
Starting with the French, each Infantry Corps in an enemy ZoC is set
to Battle Formation (flipping from Advance Formation if necessary).

<h4>
H. Withdrawal
</h4>

<p>
Each player in alternating fashion, starting with the French, may choose
a friendly Corps in an enemy ZoC and have it conduct a retreat, following all the rules of that combat result. Once a player passes, they cannot
retreat any further Corps; their opponent may then retreat up to three
more Corps in succession before ending the step. Corps that retreat into
an enemy ZoC become blown and are placed on the Game Turn Track
to return two turns ahead; if not possible, the Corps is eliminated.

<h2>
Movement Phase
</h2>

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Unlike most games, units can move multiple times and in any
sequence until both players pass.

<p>
Starting with the French, players alternate choosing a Corps to move.
Each time it is a player's chance to choose, they must either move a
Corps or pass. The same Corps may be chosen multiple times to move
during a given Movement Phase, so long as it remains eligible.

<h3>
Corps Movement
</h3>

<p>
The chosen Corps moves from hex to adjacent hex, in any combination of directions, up to a number of hexes equal to the movement
allowance of its current Formation (printed on the counter). A Corps is
never required to use its full movement allowance.

<p>
Some additional rules and restrictions:

<p>
&bull; A Corps may never enter a hex containing another Corps, enemy or
friendly, at any time.

<p>
&bull; A Corps may move through or remain in a hex containing an HQ
marker or friendly Detachment unit.

<p>
&bull; Detachments do not move, but occupy the hex they are placed in until
recalled during Step E of the Command Phase. HQ markers also do
not move, but are removed and placed again during Step A of the Command Phase.

<p>
&bull; If a Corps moves exclusively along a road, it may use Road Movement
to double its movement allowance (Infantry Corps in Battle formation
cannot use Road Movement).

<p>
&bull; A Corps cannot enter a hex beyond the Command Range of its associated HQ.

<p>
&bull; As the French have three HQs, a moving French Corps must declare
which French HQ will be used to comply with this rule for the current
move.

<p>
&bull; This range is measured in hexes (do not count the hex the HQ is
located in, but count the hex occupied by the unit). It can be traced
through units, enemy and friendly alike, and is unaffected by ZoCs,
ZoIs, or terrain.

<p>
&bull; A Corps that begins its movement outside of Command Range must
move closer to their HQ until they are within its Range, and thereafter
may not voluntarily move further than their HQ's Range. Do not count
the hex the HQ is in, only count the hex that the piece is trying to enter.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Closer means less distance, not the same distance.

<h4>
Influence on Movement by Zones of Control and
Zones of Influence:
</h4>

<p>
&bull; When an Infantry Corps enters a hex in an enemy ZoI, it must cease
movement, but remains in its current Formation.

<p>
&bull; When a Cavalry Corps enters a hex in an enemy Cavalry Corps' ZoI,
it must cease movement.

<p>
&bull; When any Corps enters a hex in an enemy ZoC, it must cease movement and flip to Battle Formation (if not already). Cavalry Corps do not
have a Battle Formation and do not flip when entering enemy ZoC.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Yes, even an enemy Detachment's ZoC will halt and flip you to
Battle Formation.

<p>
&bull; An Infantry Corps that begins movement in an enemy ZoC (or a
Cavalry Corps in an enemy Cavalry Corps' ZoC) cannot move, and can
only exit the enemy ZoC due to a combat result or by withdrawing during Step H of the Organization Phase.

<p>
&bull; A Cavalry Corps that begins movement in an enemy Infantry Corps' <mark>or detachment's</mark>
ZoC can only move to an adjacent empty hex not in enemy ZoC; it may
continue movement assuming other conditions allow.

<h3>
Passing
</h3>

<p>
When a player passes:

<p>
&bull; The passing player may no longer move any Corps for the remainder of
the Movement Phase.

<p>
&bull; The passing player's opponent rolls a die and adds 1 for each friendly
<s>unit</s><mark>Corps</mark> that is not in an enemy ZoC or ZoI (including reinforcements
available this turn that have not yet entered the map). This modified
result is the maximum number of moves the opponent may make before
ending the Movement Phase (use the mnemonic marker on the Number Track to record the number of moves remaining).

<p>
&bull; Any reinforcements that are not yet on the map must be moved onto
the map before any units on the map may move.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: The restriction that units that are off map must enter before
units on the map may move ONLY applies after one side has passed, not
before.

<p>
<b>Reinforcements</b>: Pieces that are off map but available this turn (see
scenario rules) enter play during the Movement Phase, counting from
the first map edge hex that they enter.

<p>
<b>Important</b>: If for any reason an enemy unit or its ZOC occupies the
entry hex or an adjacent hex, the enemy unit must immediately execute
a mandatory three hex Retreat result exactly as if it had
<s>loads</s><mark>lost</mark>
an attack
(or, it is Recalled if it is a Detachment). Units that also enter this turn
from that location that cannot enter the map for any reason are kept off
map until there is a hex for them to enter on this or a later turn. A unit
may not shift to another entry hex, but must enter at the indicated location. A player may not voluntarily hold a unit off map if it is possible for
it to enter play, to include after your opponent passes where additional
moves must first be used to bring on all reinforcements before making
other moves.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Gamers love to try and interdict enemy reinforcements at the map
edges. Simply stated, you cannot, and I have written these rules to reflect this
situation. Any loopholes that you perceive are misperceptions. In addition, you
must bring on all reinforcements on their turn of entry if at all possible, and
again, attempts to do something else are illegal moves.

<h2>
Attack Phase
</h2>

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Unlike most games, a player's units can attack and be attacked
multiple times and in any sequence until the unit is removed from the map, is
no longer in an enemy ZoC, or a player passes.

<p>
Starting with the French, players alternate choosing a Corps to attack
an enemy unit in their ZoC. Each time it is a player's chance to choose,
they must either attack with a Corps or pass.

<p>
The side declaring the attack is the attacker, and the opposing side is the
defender. Each attack consists of one attacking Corps (potentially with
other attacking Corps in support) attacking one defending unit (which
may get support from Cavalry Corps). All attacks are voluntary, never
mandatory. An individual unit can participate in any number attacks as
either the attacker or defender; the only condition is that a unit can only
attack a unit in its own ZoC (adjacent).

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Other than the French Grand Battery, Detachments can never
attack or support an attack, they may only defend.

<h3>
Attack Resolution
</h3>

<p>
Each player rolls one die and adds any die roll modifiers listed below.
The player with the higher total (with modifiers) wins the combat; ties
are stalemates. Subtract the lower total from the higher total to determine the specific result of the combat (see Combat Results Table and
Explanation below).

<h4>
Terrain
</h4>

<p>
&bull; The defender (only) adds 1 to their defense roll for terrain as indicated
on the Terrain Effects Chart (TEC). A maximum of +1 applies to the
defense roll for terrain.

<h4>
Battle Stars
</h4>

<p>
&bull; The attacking Corps adds its Battle Stars to the attack roll. If the
attacking Corps is in Command Range of an associated HQ in Battle
mode, add the HQ's Battle Stars as well.

<p>
&bull; The defending unit adds its Battle Stars to the defense roll. If the
defending unit is in Command Range of an associated HQ in Battle
mode, add the HQ's Battle Stars as well.

<p>
&bull; A Cavalry Corps charging into a town or chateau hex does not add
its Battle Stars to the attack roll. Cavalry Corps still add their +1 Corps
support for an attack into a town or chateau hex.

<p>
&bull; If a Fresh Cavalry Corps is supporting the attack, it may add its Battle
Stars to the attack die roll, then flip the Cavalry Corps to its Exhausted
side.

<p>
&bull; If the French Grand Battery Detachment is stacked with the attacking
Corps or any of the Corps supporting the attack, add its Battle Star to
the attack roll.

<h4>
Attack Support
</h4>

<p>
&bull; The attacker adds 1 to his attack
roll for each friendly Infantry Corps (not Detachment) that is in the
defenders ZOC.

<h4>
Cavalry Support
</h4>

<p>
&bull; The attacker adds 1 for each Cavalry Corps (not Detachment) that is
adjacent to the attacking Corps, whether or not they are in the defending unit's ZoC. The supporting Cavalry Corps can be either Fresh or
Exhausted, but if Fresh it must flip to Exhausted side.

<p>
&bull; The defender adds 1 for each Cavalry Corps (not Detachment) that is
adjacent to the defending unit, whether or not they are in the attacking
Corps' ZoC. The Cavalry Corps can be either Fresh or Exhausted, but if
Fresh it must flip to its Exhausted side.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Waterloo Campaign uses an unusual Cavalry support concept
whereby the unit does not have to be adjacent to the defending unit, just
adjacent to the attacker or defender in question. The presence of a Cavalry
unit, whether Fresh or Exhausted, represents the value of combined arms attacks in this period. It forces the defenders to remain in square, making them
more vulnerable to organic artillery fire. A Fresh Attacking Cavalry unit
adding its star bonus simulates a Cavalry Charge, a once per turn capability.
The defender cannot Cavalry Charge, but its presence (add 1) simulates local
counter charges.

<h4>
Detachments
</h4>

<p>
&bull; The attacker adds 2 to their attack roll if the defending unit is a
Detachment (Detachments stacked with Corps have no effect).

<p class="play note">
Play Note: Do not forget to flip Fresh Cavalry units that participate in a
combat (attacker or defender) onto their Exhausted side.

<p>
<b>Stalemate:</b> No effect.

<p>
<b>Retreat:</b> <s>Retreat, 1st sentence replace:</s> A unit Retreats by moving three
hexes away from the victorious enemy unit. A Retreating unit can never
enter a hex containing any Corps, friendly or enemy (HQs and friendly
Detachments are allowed), nor a hex in an enemy ZoC (including
Detachment ZoCs). Each hex of Retreat must be further from the
victorious enemy unit. If a unit cannot Retreat under these restrictions,
it becomes Blown instead and is removed from the map (see below).
Detachments that receive a Retreat result are Eliminated if stacked with
a friendly Corps, or Recalled if not.

<p>
<b>Blown:</b> A Blown Corps is removed from the map and placed on the
Game Track to return two turns later (i.e. 24 hours later). Blown units
return to play during Step B of the Command Phase on the turn they
occupy on the game turn track. During the last day of a scenario, all
Blown results are instead treated as Eliminated. If a Corps attacks a Detachment and receives a Blown result, the Corps must Retreat instead.
Detachments that receive a Blown result are Eliminated.

<p>
<b>Eliminated:</b> An Eliminated unit is removed from play for the remainder of the game. If a Corps attacks a Detachment and receives an
Eliminated result, the Corps must Retreat instead. Each Eliminated
unit counts as 3 VP (Corps) or 1 VP (Detachment) for your opponent.

<h4>
Pursuit
</h4>

<p>
If the defending unit (not attacker) vacates its hex due to any combat
result, and the attacking Corps is not in the ZoC of any other enemy
unit, the attacking Corps must move into the vacated hex.

<p class="play note">
Play Note: The attacking unit may continue attacking in subsequent attack
opportunities, so long as there is at least one enemy unit in its own ZoC and
is otherwise eligible.

<p>
After an individual attack is concluded, the players continue alternating
declaring attacks with units or passing.

<h3>
Passing
</h3>

<p>
When a player passes:

<p>
&bull; The passing player may no longer attack with any Corps for the remainder of the Attack Phase. Their units defend normally.

<p>
&bull; The passing player's opponent rolls a die. This result is the maximum
number of attacks the opponent may make before ending the Attack
Phase (use the mnemonic marker on the Number Track to record the
number of attacks remaining).

<h2>
End Phase
</h2>

<p>
After both players have passed in an Attack Phase, the turn is over.
If this was the last turn, determine the winner, otherwise advance the
Game Turn marker and begin a new turn. The French Grand Battery, if
in play, is automatically recalled.

<h3>

After the last turn, players calculate their Victory Points (VPs) as follows:

<p>
&bull; Each Eliminated Corps scores 3 VP for the opponent.

<p>
&bull; The French Imperial Guard Infantry and Cavalry Corps score 5 VP
instead of 3 VP for the Coalition player if Eliminated.

<p>
&bull; Each Eliminated unit counts as Victory Points for your opponent.

<p>
&bull; The French Old Guard and Grand Battery Detachments score 2 VP
instead of 1 VP for the Coalition player if Eliminated.

<p>
&bull; At the end of the last turn, if the French can trace a path free of Coalition units or ZoC from hexes 1017 or 1018 (marked with a B) to Halle
(4006), near Waterloo (4015), or near Wavre (4025) the French receive
5 VP.

<p class="design note">
Design Note: The Anglo-Allied army needs to maintain its line of communication to the sea through Brussels and therefore ‘turtling' in a corner of the
map to deny a French victory has a penalty.

Compare the two sides' VP to determine the Level of Victory:
</h3>

<p>
&bull; <b>Tactical Victory</b>: The side with the most VPs wins. The Coalition player
wins tie games.

<p class="tournament note">
Tournament Note: Consider a French Tactical Victory as an historical defeat
and a tournament defeat.

<p>
&bull; <b>Campaign Victory</b>: If the winning side has a margin of victory of 9 to
11 VP.

<p class="tournament note">
Tournament Note: Consider a French Campaign Victory as an historical
defeat but a tournament victory.

<p>
&bull; <b>Strategic Victory</b>: If the winning side has a margin of victory of 12 VP
or greater.

<p class="tournament note">
Tournament Note: Consider a French Strategic Victory as an historical and
tournament victory.

<p class="historical note">
Historical Note: A great historical question is, what would a French
victory look like? Even if Napoleon had won a strategic victory it is
not clear that this would have represented more than a reprieve; but
who knows? The Austrian and Russian armies were still mustering and
moving toward the French frontier, so France was far from out of the
woods. However, a successful campaign in the Netherlands (Belgium)
would have solidified Napoleon's political situation and allowed him to
redeploy the Armée du Nord to defend France's eastern borders.

<p class="historical note">
Prior to Napoleon reentering the picture, the Coalition negotiations
in Vienna were tense and had the potential to lead to inter-allied
conflict, so would a resurgence of Napoleon's military reputation have
led to some negotiated settlement? Any level of Coalition victory puts
you back on the historical narrative. Even a French tactical victory
is unlikely to change history, just allowing for the writing of another
chapter in the story. A French campaign victory places you in a gray area
where other circumstances might have allowed Napoleon to turn things
around with further victories against the Austrians or the Russians.
However, France's limited manpower resources, not to mention horse
shortages, may have just delayed the historical outcome a bit more; who
can say? As an historical gamer I live to see alternative narratives plausibly play out, which is what I think a strategic victory might represent.
For argument's sake, a French strategic victory opens the possibility that
you have dramatically changed history.

<p class="historical note">
Historical Note: The main scenario begins one day into the campaign, after the French have crossed the Sambre River. As it turns out,
the key day of this campaign was not June 18th, the Battle of Waterloo,
but June 16th and the twin Battles of Quatre Bras and Ligny, where the
ideal conditions for a decisive victory created by Napoleon went astray
due to poor staff work, Ney's mistakes, and the Emperor's inability to
make up for the collective friction this imposed on his well-conceived
plans.

<p class="historical note">
Historical Note:  It has been reported that upon realizing the
extent of the French operation Wellington stated, “Napoleon has
humbugged me by God, he has gained twenty-four hours' march
on me”. The special rules for the first day are meant to capture this
historical circumstance.

<p class="design note">
Design Note: The Special Rules try to account for the narrative
factors that drove significant delays in the movement and coordination
of forces that led to Napoleon's defeat. If you want to see a different

<h2>
Designer's Notes
</h2>

<p>
After all of these years I have finally gone back to my
roots and designed a Gettysburg game (C3i Magazine
Nr32 and Deluxe Boxed Edition from RBM Studio) that has
resulted in an expanded American Civil War series coming from GMT
Games (Volume 1: Rebel Fury). To complete this circle of life, the
only thing left for me to do was to design a game on the Waterloo
Campaign 1815. When I started this design, I intended for it to
roughly adhere to its Civil War predecessor, but that did not capture the
true feel of this campaign. This necessitated several major changes such
as the more nuanced and detailed Detachment rules that were critical to
simulating this campaign at the corps level.

<p>
What I find fascinating is that Napoleon lost the Campaign on
the afternoon of June 16th and on the morning of June 17th when he
failed to destroy the Prussian Army at Ligny (June 16th), and missed an
opportunity to then smash Wellington who was unaware that the Prussians were no longer on his flank (June 17th). Napoleon's plan at Ligny
was to force Blücher to commit all of his reserves against his inferior
sized force and then have the Ist Corps fall on the Prussian right rear
to deliver the coup de grace. Due to epic confusion, d'Erlon's Ist Corps
did not participate at Ligny or Quatre Bras. Although Napoleon won
a tactical victory at Ligny, a decisive outcome fell from his grasp. To
compound this failure a lethargic French army missed its chance to
catch Wellington without Prussian support. Essentially a brilliant plan
fell apart due to poor situation awareness and execution. The subsequent
battle of Waterloo was the decisive outcome, but the writing was already
on the wall.

<p>
One of my first wargames was Avalon Hill's Waterloo. What I
always found frustrating with that game was you never fought the battle
of Waterloo, but a series of engagements against a frontline. Most other
Waterloo campaign games (I've played most of them) rarely seem to
create the historical incentives for fighting a big battle. At this scale
the Battle of Waterloo (June 18th) is represented by four Anglo-Allied
corps with a four-hex frontage (Cavalry in reserve) versus five French
corps (I, IInd, VIth, Imperial Guard, Guard Cavalry). Based on the
historical model, you will usually get one or two strong attacks and, if
not successful, you try to bring up more forces for another assault. The
famous battle would see the French fail to make headway in their first
attacks, likely having one blown unit (IInd Corps) and then on the next
turn the Prussian IVth Corps would enter the fray and create the tactical edge for an Allied victory.

<p>
On a personal note, due to work assignments in the late 1980's I
spent numerous extended periods of time in the Brussels area. I have
been at Waterloo around a dozen times and I have walked and seen
all of the major engagement areas from the June 16th twin battles of
Quatre Bras and Ligny. What I realized is there were many alternate
locations in this region where Waterloo could have been fought. In fact,
a year earlier Wellington had his engineers survey numerous locations
in the region where he was willing to fight a battle. To extend this point
further, it turns out the Prussians used some of the English maps during
their retreat from Ligny to Wavre. When I was considering where to put
defensible terrain on the map, I realized that a better simulation would
be to invest the defense bonus in how a commander would deploy his
forces on any given piece of appropriate ground. This concept allows you
to open the historical aperture based on the conditions in your game
sessions on where to maneuver your forces and fight the battle of Waterloo. This has all been made possible by the beautiful C3i game map
crafted by my good friend Charlie Kibler.

<p>
The result of my thinking is a new mechanic for the Gettysburg
system, where I rate HQs for both maneuver and battle. When you have
an HQ on its battle side in essence Wellington, Napoleon, and Blücher
are deploying their forces to best make best use of the terrain. What
this achieved is the game's narrative now has more scope on where and
when a decisive battle can be fought. I am quite pleased with how this
has played out.

<p>
One thing that I have thought long and hard on is how to portray a
Napoleonic battle. What is fascinating is the historical reality that, when
armies are equipped and organized in a similar manner, battles tend to
be attrition-oriented affairs where victory goes to the side with the last
reserve. This similar phenomenon can be seen during the campaigns of
Alexander's Successors where battles between two Macedonian armed
and organized forces were bloodbaths, unlike the decisive outcomes
against a Persian asymmetrically organized force. In this campaign the
Armies are armed with nearly identical technology organized along
similar lines. By their very nature, attacks in this period were decided by
mass and use of terrain giving one side or the other an advantage across
a wide range of tactical outcomes.

<p>
One of the major challenges for this design and any Napoleonic
design is how to portray cavalry and its importance to tactics in this
period. I feel that allowing a cavalry corps to support an attack when not
in the defender's zone of control captures the combined arms dimension
of tactics at this level in a way that is a departure from the past. Lastly,
the ability of a cavalry unit to deliver a charge once a turn and the
difficulty in resting the unit so it can replenish this capability seems to
capture this important dimension of cavalry operations.

<p>
My final points will deal with how I have portrayed the order of
battle and leadership. I have an extensive collection of Napoleonic
sources for this campaign, to include several battalion level orders of
battle. I was certainly not lacking in information on who participated
and where they were throughout this campaign.

<p>
Very roughly, the Armee du Norse had roughly 120k soldiers (350
guns) and the Allied armies had approximately 120k each (180 guns
total).  It is my view that collectively the two sides were roughly equivalent in quality. The French army is slightly better than its Anglo-Allied
counterpart (8 stars to 7) and far superior to the Prussian army who only
rates 2 stars. This is based on my analysis of the situation that will likely
raise lots of informed debate, but know that I have given this considerable thought and analysis.

<p>
The Prussian army was well led, but contained large quantities of
Landwehr (militia) units, with many of the soldiers having reported for
duty less than 30 days before the campaign. While they were motivated,
their tactical competence was several notches below that of the other
two armies in this campaign. The Prussian's did not have an independent
cavalry corps, as their mounted arm was distributed and controlled by
their four large corps. However, in practice the Prussian senior leadership (Blücher/Gneisenau) appear to have directly given orders to cavalry
units during Ligny and the retreat. In keeping with the actual tactics,
I have separated them out into an independent Corp. To capture their
penny packet utilization, the Prussian cavalry is not given a quality
star due to organization and their use in small detachments. You will
find that the Prussian army is vulnerable to a massed French army if
Wellington cannot put counter pressure on the situation. What I have
found is Allied strategy mirrors history as an emergent property and not
a special rule.

<p>
Breaking with tradition, I have shown Wellington's army to be of
higher quality than other games have rated them in the past. As this is a
corps-level simulation, each of the British corps are a mixture of British
Regulars, German allies, and Dutch units, many of whom were recently
part of the French army under Napoleon before his exile. Each of the
three British corps are rated as equivalent to the Imperial Guard. Let
that one sit for a moment. While the Imperial Guard had a well-earned
reputation, many were now men in their late 30's and early 40's, and the
Young Guard component were not uniformly elite units. On the other
hand, the British regulars, most of whom were not Peninsular veterans,
performed as elite units during the battle. That said, if the British use
their detachments to secure their flanks, the Hill Corps is diminished to
reflect this historical factor.

<p>
Each of the three British corps had British infantry divisions aligned
with Allied troops. The Allied troops were of varying quality, but one
would expect that I would lower the quality of the British corps based
on the perception that the two Netherland divisions and German Allies
were inferior. In particular the Prince of Orange (23 years old) seems
to get a lot of negative press from the British histories. However, if you
take a fresh look at the situation, the young Prince (I Corps Commander) actually performed quite well on June 15th as he and his chief
of staff (Constant) were the only senior Allied commanders to take the
early reports of French attacks seriously. Orange took the initiative and
began to concentrate his spread-out forces and shift them into useful
positions such as Quatre Bras. When you evaluate the performance of
the 2nd Netherlands division at Quatre Bras, they managed to hold the
line against an escalating French attack until they were overwhelmed. I
am hard pressed to represent this as inferior performance. In the end it
appears to me that the British corps were not measurably diluted in performance by the Allied troops and I rated these units on their superior
performance in this campaign compared to their French counterparts.

<p>
The French army consisted of five infantry corps plus the Imperial
Guard and had a superior organization for its cavalry. The Guard and
Reserve Cavalry Corps account for three of the eight French quality
stars. It should be noted that Kellerman's Cuirassiers are included in
the Guard Cavalry. In general, the French army was probably a notch
above the British and their more flexible organization gives them more
maneuver units than the British. This is a key factor on how the French
army might prevail in a stand-up battle against the Anglo-Allied army
if the French player can bring more Attack support to bear.

<p>
One should remember that each unit is usually making one attack
per turn, representing half a day's worth of tactical encounters in one
die roll. If one considers the French Ist Corps assault (one-star quality)
on La Haye Sainte (hex 3616) against Wellington's Reserve Corps (two
stars), the British would get +4 additional DRM (two Wellington HQ,
+1 chateau, +1 Cavalry support) for a total of +6 DRM. The French
would get an additional +3 DRM (Napoleon HQ, Grand Battery, +1
Cavalry support), for a total of +3 yielding a total of +4 DRM.
This attack in the aggregate conforms to the historical model where
the French temporarily took the position after repeated assaults. If the
French were unsuccessful in their first try, the next assault would likely
occur next turn as the French cavalry is now exhausted and will not
become fresh due to their proximity to the Anglo-Allied army, while Ist
Corps has retreated or suffered a worse result.

<p>
My last remarks will be on how I rated the key leaders in this
campaign, or how is Napoleon rated versus his opponents. Again, not
keeping with tradition, Napoleon is not the best general in this campaign. In Battle mode Wellington is a straight up two versus one star
for Napoleon and Blücher. However, if Napoleon can deploy the Grand
Battery, he neutralizes Wellington two to two in an attack. I intend
to use this system for a future series on Napoleon's campaigns and his
earlier incarnations will likely be two or three star rated. Blücher was the
star (so he gets one) of this campaign, as it was his intransigence that,
after a defeat, he persevered and used his last fresh corps (Bülow) to save
the day at Waterloo.

<p>
Cleary Ney and Grouchy both performed poorly in this campaign.
They are included to give the French operational flexibility to spread
out while Napoleon is in Battle mode. When they are near Napoleon
their battle star represents them as an extension of Napoleon under his
direct command. When they are operating independently and in battle
mode you will note that they have only a two and not a three range. This
nuance when coupled with the HQ placement rules means that they are
essentially only able to support a single attack with their star. What I am
representing is Ney or Grouchy personally leading an attack. Ney may
not have been a genius, but he wasn't called the Bravest of the Brave for
nothing.

<p>
I hope you enjoy my first and likely only Waterloo design. For me it
filled in one of the campaigns that I have always wanted to publish. So,
beat the drums and see if you can change history as the old SPI ads use
to say.

<h2>
Clarifications
</h2>

<p>
These items clarify potentially ambiguous parts of the rules. The resolutions are drawn from the designer's online postings.

<h5>
Cavalry Exhaustion
</h5>

<p>
Cavalry becomes exhausted whenever it participates in combat, as attacker, defender, or as support.

<h5>
Battle Formation
</h5>

<p>
Infantry Corps must enter Battle Formation as soon as they find themselves
inside an enemy Zone of Control (not only when they enter an enemy
ZoC as a result of their movement). For example, if a friendly Cavalry
Corps moves adjacent to an enemy Infantry Corps in Advance Formation,
placing the Infantry Corps inside of the Cavalry's Zone of Control, then
the enemy Infantry Corps must flip to Battle Formation. If a friendly
Infantry Corps does the same, then both the friendly and enemy Infantry
Corps must flip to Battle Formation.

<h5>
Command Range and Roads
</h5>

<p>
Even though the rules in the definition of Road Movement say that Normal
mode HQ Command Range is doubled when traced entirely over roads, the
designer asserts this applies only to the placement of detachments:

<blockquote>
The fact that an HQ in Normal mode can place a detachment at twice its
range if it is tracing along roads does not in any other situation extend
the HQ's Command Range.
</blockquote>

<p>

<h5>
Anglo-Allied/Prussian Cavalry Support
</h5>

<p>
Anglo-Allied cavalry may not support Prussian attacks, nor may Prussian cavalry support Anglo-Allied attacks.

<h5>
Defending Cavalry Battle Stars
</h5>

Cavalry defending in a town do not add their Battle Stars to their defense rolls.
